#
# (Slurm) job manager for the GitHub App for the EESSI project
#
# This tool monitors EESSI build jobs and acts on state changes of
# these jobs. It releases jobs initially held, it processes running and
# finished jobs and reports status changes/results back to the
# corresponding GitHub pull request to a target software-layer repository.
#
# EESSI build jobs are recognised by
#  - being submitted in JobUserHeld status (sbatch parameter --hold)
#  - job ids listed in a specific directory (ids being symlinks to job
#    directories created by EESSI bot)
#  - a metadata file in the job's working directory
#
# This file is part of the EESSI build-and-deploy bot,
# see https://github.com/EESSI/eessi-bot-software-layer
#
# The bot helps with requests to add software installations to the
# EESSI software layer, see https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer
